            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>Ayurveda is a science of life with a holistic approach to health.
            Ayurveda has ability to treat many chronic diseases such as arthritis,
            chronic sinusitis, cancer, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome and
            asthma. Evidence-based research is highly needed for global
            recognition and acceptance of ayurveda, which needs further
            advancements in the research methodology. The vimana sthana is a
            unique and detailed section having an explanation contributed
            by Charaka on research. The vimana sthana has been positioned
            between the nidan sthan and the sharir sthan. The position after
            the nidan sthan is valid as it is the confirmation of the need of the
            measurement of the doshadi factors i.e., dosh, desh, kaal, bheshaj,
            sharir, sar, ahar, sattav, satmya prakriti after the assessment of the
            diagnosis described in the nidana sthana. The viman sthan therefore is the specific section
            dedicated to the measurement or the knowledge unit. The research is the fact supported with
            figures that involve the measurement which is the root of discussion in the vimana Sthana. In
            fact, the eighth chapter of the Vimana Sthana is the treasure of the Basic Principles of
            research in ayurveda. Thus, the Vimana Sthana of the Charaka Samhita is the foundation
            stone or the guiding principle for the research activity.
            Ayurvedic treatment is although highly effective; proper mode of action, pharmacology,
            pharmacokinetics, and pharmacovigilance of many important Ayurvedic drugs are still not
            fully explored. Moreover, the comprehensive knowledge of the basic ideologies of ayurveda
            is poorly acceptable scientifically due to lack of evidence. In the modern time, when the
            Western medicinal system is reached almost at the top because of validated research and
            advanced techniques, there is an urgent need to validate basic principles as well as drugs used in the
            ayurvedic
            system of medicine with the help of advanced research methodology.
            Therefore, advancements in the ongoing research methodology are highly required for the
            promotion of ayurveda.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Research and Research Methodology</h3>Research comprises defining and redefining problems, formulating
            hypothesis or suggested
            solutions, collecting, organizing and evaluating data, making deductions and reaching
            conclusions, and at last carefully testing the conclusions to determine whether they fit the
            formulating hypothesis.[1] Research methodology is a way to solve the research problem
            systematically. It may be understood as a science of studying how research is done
            scientifically. We study the various steps that are generally adopted by the researchers in
            studying research problem. Research follows a scientific way of establishing facts. All those
            methods which are used by the researcher during the course of studying the research problem
            are termed as research methods. Like any other organized work, research requires proper
            planning, that systematizes the research work. Ayurveda experts have followed certain
            research methods and methodology. The traditionally established truths need to be validated
            in scientific manner. Validation of ancient methods of investigation or research will
            ultimately lead to establishment of ayurveda as a science which will contribute to broad
            domain of Indian research methodology. The critical scientific approach of ayurveda is
            evident from various ancient methods.

            <p>
            <h3>Karan (Researcher/Physician)
            </h3>Acharya Charaka has defined doer, performer of the task or subject (Karta) as a karan.
            Karta (doer) is an agent who initiates action independently.[3] Karta is considered to be the
            cause of an action. Physician is given prime importance in treatment among chtushpada.
            Research is an attitude complemented effectively by action. The attitudes conducive to
            research have two aspects: One is curiosity; the other is courage. The action needed for
            research also has two aspects: one is acquiring existing knowledge and skills necessary to do
            the research activities and the other is the determination to follow a plan. One should have the
            above-mentioned qualities to become a good researcher. According to charak samhita, a
            physician is considered to be endowed with qualities such as examiner, a person knowing
            logical planning, a person with insightful understanding, endowed with prescribing
            knowledge and many more.[4]
            These are nothing but the qualities of a researcher such as
            motivation, interest, commitment and critical scientific approach. Qualities of a physician as
            given in charak samhita can be compared with that of a researcher, as both of them are
            involved in the critical study of their respective subject matter.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Kaaran (instruments/ Research method)</h3>The instrument which helps an agent to perform an action is
            called
            as Karana. Drugs are
            considered as kaaran or instrument of a physician for the accomplishment of treatment.[5]
            For
            a researcher, instruments can be considered as research methods employed by him during the
            course of studying his research problem. All those methods which are used by the researcher
            during the course of studying the research problem are termed as research methods. Scientific
            research methods call for explanations based on collected facts, measurements and
            observations and not on reasoning alone. The investigational product or procedures under
            trial can also be considered as kaaran.
            [6]
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Karyayoni (Area defined for Research/ Source of an action)</h3>Which becomes an action by the process of
            transformation is called as source of an action.[7]
            It can also be said that Karyayoni is that which attains the status of action after
            transformation. Source of an action remains in inseparable relation with action or effect. A
            cause transforms itself into an effect. This is considered to be the origin of
            action. Karyayoni is a state of imbalance of Dosha-Dhatu-Mala or diseased condition of a
            patient which is the area of interest for a physician.[8]
            In research, source of an action
            (Karyayoni) can be considered as a Research problem or Research question.[9]
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Kaarya (Aim and objectives/Action)</h3>Karya is a state of equilibrium of dosha-dhatu-mala (dhatu-samya)
            which is the objective of
            a Physician.[10]
            For a researcher, Kaarya can be considered as aims and objectives or purpose
            of a research study. The purpose of research is to discover answers to questions through the
            application of scientific procedures.[11]
            The main aim of research is to find the truth which is
            hidden and which has not been discovered yet. Operational phase of research which consists
            of construction of tools of data collection, processing of data and analysis of data and
            interpretation of results can also be considered as a kaarya.
            [12]
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Kaaryaphal (Outcome of research)</h3>Karyaphala or object for which the action is initiated.[13]
            For a physician, outcome is an
            attainment of happiness, i.e., the state of freedom from disease. For a researcher, outcome can
            be considered as endpoints or outcomes of the research study.[14]
            The variable capable of
            providing the most clinically relevant and convincing evidence related to the primary
            objective of the trial is called as an endpoint of the study. There are two types of endpoints:
            direct and surrogate. Direct endpoint is directly related to the primary objective of the trial
            and crucial to specify its precise definition and rationale for selection. A surrogate endpoint
            of a clinical trial is a laboratory measurement or a physiological sign used as a substitute for a
            clinically meaningful endpoint that measures directly how a patient feels, functions, or
            survives. Both these endpoints can be compared with Karyaphala (outcome), which the
            researcher tries to achieve through various operations.[15]
            Anubandh (Long term effects /Subsequent manifestation)
            After effect good or bad is Anubandha. Longevity is subsequent manifestation in
            treatment.[16]
            Long-term effects of research study can be considered as subsequent
            manifestation in case of research study.[17]
            Teleological ethics can also be thought of in this
            context. Teleological ethics is a theory of morality that derives duty or moral obligation from
            what is good or desirable as an end to be achieved. Thalidomide tragedy is a realistic example
            of teleological ethics. Impacts of research on society can also be considered in subsequent
            manifestation.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Desh (location or habitat)</h3>Desh represents the site favourable or unfavourable to an action.[18]
            Both
            the land and the
            patient constitute Desh in case of a physician. Selection of study site plays an important role
            in any research study.[19] Geographical distribution is considered for selection of samples as
            well as interpretation of results. Ecological studies can be considered under Desh factor,
            which are meant to explore the statistical connection between disease in different population
            groups and estimated exposures in groups rather than individuals. The geographic
            information is a very useful tool that improves the ability of ecological studies to be able to
            determine a link between health data and a source of environmental exposure.[20]</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Kaal (Time and Stage)
            </h3>Time and Stage when Research is being carried out. Kaal is nothing but a process of
            transformation into seasons etc.[21]
            Time period is also an important aspect for a research
            study. Inference of the cause from the effect relates to the past. This can be correlated with
            the case–control study design (i.e., retrospective study). Inference of the effect from the cause
            relates to the future. This can be correlated with prospective study design. The commonly
            observed events at present can be correlated with cross-sectional study design. Time also
            relates to season in which study is to be conducted. Epidemiological studies (pertaining to
            time) also require time factor to be taken into consideration.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Pravriti (Execution - Entire Research/ initiation of action)</h3>Pravritti (initiation of action)
            represents
            the initiation of action as a means to accomplishment
            of an objectives and this is beginning of action.[22]
            Pravritti is the effort taken for the
            accomplishment of objective. In the context of treatment, pravritti is the initiation of
            therapeutic action. For a researcher, motivation in research can be considered as
            a pravritti.
            [23]</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Upaya (means of action/ Research plan)</h3>Upaya (means of action) stands for bringing about excellence
            in
            the agent, the instrument,
            and the origin of action and their proper setting. The excellence of the physician and the
            correctness of the therapy constitute upaya (means of action).[24]
            Excellence of researcher,
            suitable research methods, proper selection and definition of research problem, and
            formulation of hypothesis helpful for smooth operation of plan of work can be considered
            as upaya (means of action). Dashavidha parikshya bhava can be correlated with one of the
            major steps involved in research, i.e., planning. Proper planning before performance of any
            task is always praised by the authoritative persons.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Description of Dashavidha Parikshya Bhava
            </h3>It is required to show the applicability of ancient methods of research in the present era in
            various fields of research confined to Ayurveda such as fundamental, literary, clinical and
            drug research. The traditionally established truths need to be validated in scientific manner.
            Validation of ancient methods of investigation or research will ultimately lead to
            establishment of ayurveda as a science which contributes to broad domain of Indian research
            methodology.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>ROLE OF PRAMANA AS A RESEARCH TOOL</h3>Research can be considered as a journey from an idea that is
            formulating a research problem
            to a valid conclusion. In ayurveda praman can be considered as a scientific tool of research.
            These pramanas are not only useful in rog and rogi pariksha but also it is useful to
            understand the principles of ayurveda thoroughly. Charak has advised to adopt these
            pramanas as a tool to get clear and entire knowledge of ayurveda. Praman can be considered
            as one of the ancient methods of research in developing the research methodology in
            ayurveda.[25] According to Charaka the things of universe such as sat (existence) or asat (nonexistence)
            can be
            investigated by these trividh pramanas and the same are helpful in
            swasthaya rakshanam, rog pariksha, rogi pariksha, dravya pariksha and chikitsa. Real
            knowledge or actual happening is known as prama or the truth, whereas the means by which
            the truth is checked is known as pramana. In other words, it can be said that praman is the
            means that detect the difference between truth and lie, actual and virtual. Charak considers
            pramana as means of pariksha karam and those are important in diagnosis, prognosis and
            treatment namely pratyaksh, anuman, Aaptopadesh.[26]
            <ol>
                <li> Aaptopadesh Pramana</li>
                <li>Pratyaksh Pramana</li>
                <li> Anuman Pramana</li>
            </ol>
            These Pramanas are very much useful at all steps of research such as
            <ol>
                <li>Planning of research work,</li>
                <li>Executing the plan of research and</li>
                <li> Finding the conclusion</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Aaptopadesh</h3>Term Aaptopadesh is generally confined only with the individual or personality. Aapta is
            not
            merely an individual but also it includes written documents like vedas, samhitas, different
            manuscripts etc.[27] Nowadays various research journal, different scientific website can be
            taken or considered as aapta. Before any research or proposed study, we follow the steps i.e.,
            a review of the literature which can be correlated with aaptopadesh. It helps to get
            fundamental understanding about any research problem and on the basis of previous research
            work done, one can plan further on next study as for the scope of research. Aapta vachana is
            universal truth. In short aapta means precisely speaker and the things which are said by these
            aaptas are considered as aaptopadesh. The knowledge given by aapta is considered as
            praman.
            Qualities of Aapta <ol>
                <li> Those who were free from raj and tam.</li>
                <li> They have knowledge of all the three kalas past, present and future.</li>
                <li> They have un-doubtful knowledge.
                    A researcher who wants to research on one topic get idea about that topic with the help of
                    previous researches. Hence the work which was previously proved scientifically will become
                    Aapta for that new research study. Researcher should acquire the existing knowledge and
                    training in physical and mental skills which is necessary to do the activities implied in
                    research. The existing knowledge of science can be acquired through Aaptopadesh.[28]</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Importance of Aaptopadesh Pramana</h3>Aaptopadesh is helpful in Rog Pariksha and chikitsa. Thus,
            Aaptopadesh
            is considered as
            reliable source of existing knowledge, which suggest new ideas for Research and also it helps
            in the development of research methodology.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Pratyaksh Pramana</h3>The knowledge which is perceived by the sense organs and mind is called as
            pratyaksh
            and
            the medium of it is called as pratyaksh pramana.
            [29] Charak in vimana sthan said that the
            proper knowledge of the disease can be gained through three pramanas; aaptopadesh
            pramana, pratyaksh pramana and anuman pramana. Out of these, by using pratyaksh
            pramana except rasa, other senses i.e., shabd, sparsh, roop and gandh can be perceived
            directly.[30]
            Thus, pratyaksh pramana helps in rogi and rog pariksha. To make any research,
            one should collect the data first, then after that analysis and final conclusion will be drawn.
            So, for the collection of data for any research, there are two main approaches:
            <ol>
                <li> information which is required is already exist or available and only we have to extract it.</li>
                <li> New and fresh information we have to collect</li>
                <li> Also, as we know that, the types of data according to sources are primary and secondary
                    data. Among these, the data which is collected from primary sources are known as
                    primary data. this can be achieved by observation and through questionnaire or by the
                    direct interview method.</li>
                <li> These methods of Collection of data more or less depend upon pratyaksh pramana. Out
                    of other methods of observation like experiments, survey and records, the experiment and
                    up to some extent of survey method depends upon this pratyaksh pramana. Pratyaksh
                    pramana is depending upon five senses organs and mind and this type of knowledge
                    gained directly. But it has some limitations which were mentioned in our samhitas as
                    pratyaksh badhak bhav.

                    [31]</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Importance of Pratyaksh Pramana</h3>in this way pratyaksh helps in rogi pariksha and rog pariksha. For
            darshan, sparshan and
            prashan pariksha- it is the base for the diagnosis and prognosis of a disease. To check the
            improvement in a patient pratyaksh is compulsory. Ashatwidha pariksha, dasvidh pariksha,
            sthanik pariksha need mostly the support of pratyaksh. It gives reliable information about
            physical and mental changes in patient.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Anuman Praman</h3>Anuman is indirect knowledge which is based on reasoning or inference and the
            inference is
            based on prior perception.[32] On the basis of direct perception, inference of three kalas i.e.,
            past, present and future will be drawn. Anuman praman is very essential in rog and rogi
            pariksha. It also helps to establish the cause effect relationship according to ayurveda. As we
            know in direct perception there are many obstacles i.e., pratyaksh badhak bhav and indirect
            knowledge cannot be gained by pratyaksh praman, hence to overcome this the anuman
            praman helps. it helps in getting knowledge and plays an important role in interpretation of
            results.[33]
            This interpretation of results is done by drawing the interference from collected
            data after doing its analysis or experiments.
            Anuman praman is of two types:
            <ol>
                <li> Swarthanuman: it is for one’s own self, the effort was made to get knowledge for that
                    person himself.</li>
                <li> Prarthanuman: it is used to provide knowledge to others. after getting knowledge by own
                    it should be demonstrated to others and for that purpose five component of reasoning are
                    stated. so, with help of these Panchvayavay Vakya (5 component of reasoning) the
                    inference is drawn is known as prarthanuman.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Panch Vakya</h3>Ancient Ayurvedic scholar adopted Panch Vakya as method of research.
            [34]
            <ol>

                <li> Pratigya</li>
                <li> Hetu</li>
                <li> Udaharan</li>
                <li> Upnayan</li>
                <li> Nigman
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li> Pratigya: Pratigya is a statement of what is to be proved. it can also be defined as an
                    assertion about the object to be proved. first step of our research is to find out problem and
                    then define it in a proper way. Pratigya can also be called as proposition of hypothesis. After
                    the statement of hypothesis next step is to establishment of the fact that is sthapna. The
                    confirmation of the hypothesis is done on the basis of hetu, udharan, upnayan and nigman.</li>
                <li> Hetu is defined as the cause of the knowledge or observation of object. Hetu can be
                    considered as aims and objectives based on need for taking research activity which is based
                    on valid knowledge that is pramana.</li>
                <li> Udaharana or drishtant is what arouses same understanding in both fool and learned
                    persons. Drishtant can also be called as universal truth, established work, active instance or
                    example. it supports the validity of the statement.</li>
                <li> Upanaya is relation between the two things i.e., correlation. it can also be called as
                    comparative study on facts and figures to prove the hypothesis. it helps to illustrate the
                    problem and give logical sequences to previous steps.</li>
                <li> Nigman is conclusion which is drawn through logical sequence, example and correlation.
                    nigman validates the pratigya or hypothesis.
                    All these Steps from pratigya (statement of the problem), hetu (tools of Collection of data
                    and means and methods of Investigation), drishtant (Collection of data example and instance)
                    upanaya (assessment of observed data) and nigaman (conclusion by interpretation of the data
                    and the results obtained) leads to establishment of theory. So panchavyava vakya along with
                    other vaad marg is methodology adopted by ancient aacharya for establishment of facts.</li>
            </ol>

           <u> <h2>SYSTEMATISED ANALYSIS OF VADAMARGPADAS /SCOPE AND
                UTILIZATION FOR RESEARCH</h2></u>
            <p>
            <h3>Vaad Marga
            </h3>Acharya Charaka divides methods of gaining knowledge in to three categories as
            <ol>
                <li> Adhyayana – Method of study</li>
                <li> Adhyapana – Method of teaching</li>
                <li> Tadvidya Sambhasha – (Seminars / Symposium/ Debate)</li>
            </ol>
            for these 44 terms are narrated with the word of vada marga. Vada aims to establish new
            creative ideas/ research work. Vada marga lays a border for discussion.[35]
            It makes
            discussion essentially end with conclusion. In charaka samhita the concepts are established
            on the basis of the vada’s in several places. Organizing the knowledge gained and power of
            expression will be achieved with the use of vada marga padas in debates and it is the
            essential component for the demonstration and presentment of research. Vada (debate) is that
            in which one holds academic discussion with an opponent. This is briefly of 2 types jalpa and
            vitanda. Jalpa of speaker’s own view as well as the opponent’s view. During debate, they
            advance arguments in support of their own views and expose the opponents’ view, this is
            jalpa. Vitanda is opposite to jalpa one holds the view that rebirth is there while the other
            holds the view just against it. Vitanda is opposite to which the speaker without having any
            positive approach only finds faults in the opponents view point.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>Today, the cost of health care is constantly rising, and affecting people’s ability to
            afford
            health coverage. Ayurveda has evolved as a holistic system having an understanding of
            physiology enabling it to maintain and restore health with a few side effects and will focus
            rather on health. The critical scientific approach of ayurveda is evident from various ancient
            methods such as:
            <ol>
                <li> Dashavidha parikshya bhava (Tenfold of investigation)</li>
                <li> Praman</li>
                <li> Vada marg (logical terms useful in discussion)</li>
            </ol>
            Classical literature of ayurveda has encapsulated wisdom of protocols for documentations
            and research in ayurveda. Ayurveda requires more researches in the areas of fundamental
            principles and diagnostic tools in place of drug research. In the present scenario, the research methodology
            of
            ayurveda needs further advancements in the development and promotion of
            Ayurveda.</p>
