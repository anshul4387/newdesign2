            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>Mental health is important at every stage of life. Mental health is an
            integral part of life. Mental wellbeing is not the absence of negative
            thoughts and feelings. We all face difficult and challenging situations
            that cause us to feel angry, sad and overwhelmed. It is about being able
            to understand and manage those feelings, so that generally able to feel
            confident and maintain positive mindset. Mental health includes our
            emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we
            think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate
            to others, and make choices. Mental health is very important
            component of health. According to WHO: "Health is a state of
            complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
            absence of disease or infirmity."[1] An important implication of this
            definition is that mental health is more than just the absence of mental
            diseases. In Ayurveda, perfect health is defined as "a balance between body, mind, spirit, and
            social wellbeing. In Ayurveda it is mentioned that the doshas must be in equilibrium, the
            digestive fire or Agni must be in a balanced state and the tissues /Dhatus and wastes or Malas
            must work in a normal state. The sensory and motor organs and mind, atma must be in a
            happy state. This is a definition of Swastha /healthy person.
            [2] Mental health is essential to
            our overall well-being. It is equally important as physical health. When we are mentally well,
            it increases our productivity, we become more focused and energetic. There are 3 types of
            treatment in Ayurveda; Daivyapashray Chikitsa, Yuktivyapashray Chikitsa and Satwawajay
            Chikitsa. Sattvavajaya Chikitsa is a method of withdrawal of the mind from unwholesome objects.[3] Aim of
            Sattvavajaya Chikitsa is control of mind. Satwavajaya Chikitsa is useful in
            emotional disorders, psycho-somatic disorders and Chronic disorders. Some more traditional
            mental health promoting practices are correct behavior (sadvrtt), Aachar Rasayana and yoga.</p>

            <h3>KEYWORD:</h3>Mental health, Swastha, Sadvritta, Aachar Rasayana, Yoga.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>Mental health is very important component of health. Mental health means keeping our
            mind
            positive and healthy. Most of the people focus only on physical health, but mental health is
            also equally important. People tend to ignore the wellness of their mind. Both physical and
            mental health is equally important.
            Studies estimate that at least 10% of the world‟s population is affected by mental illness and
            that 20% of children suffer from mental disorders. A study reveals that 56 million of Indian
            population suffers from depression and 38 million suffers from anxiety disorders. Cases are
            growing significantly every day.
            Mental wellness implies a state of psychological well-being. It denotes having a positive
            sense of how we feel, thinks, and act, which improves one‟s ability to enjoy life and to
            remain happy. Mental wellness term is being used by psychologists to denote logical-positive
            thinking, clear comprehension and reasoning ability.
            A combined approach that includes both mental and physical health can improve overall
            health. Now it is proved that treating mental disorder and chronic illness together can help
            people better manage both anxiety, depression and chronic disease.
            Mental sickness is becoming a growing issue in present time. Mental illness is common these
            days and can affect anyone in society. People are still reluctant to accept the illness of mind
            because of stigma related to mental disorders. They feel inferior to talk about mental
            disorders. Mental health cannot be separated from physical health. They both are equally
            important for a person. Our society needs to change its perception of mental disorder. If the
            mental illness is not treated at the correct time, then the consequences can be grave.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Concepts of mental health in ayurveda
            </h3>
            <h3>Concept of mana</h3>Mana is the entity through which the knowledge is obtained. The entity which makes a
            person knowledgeable is mana. Mana is the superior analyzing faculty and controls the whole
            body. Mana is an ubhayendriya, which perceives the signals and relays them to budhi and
            further buddhi guides Karmendriya to act accordingly.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>3 Faculties of mana</h3>According to Chakrapani the knowledge, which is having three faculties as Dhee,
            Dhriti and
            Smriti. Dhee, Dhruti, and Smruti are the three main faculties, which are closely related to
            Manas. Dhee (Perception), Dhriti (Retention) and (Memory) are the entities which are
            responsible for attaining, holding and recalling of the knowledge. Dhee is the intellectual and
            discriminating power of mind that identifies the right and wrong. Dhriti is the ability of
            holding knowledge which was perceived in past and to utilize that knowledge against the
            subjects. Samriti means remembrance, memory or recalling power of mind. It is the ability to
            recall the past experiences.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Trigunatwa of mana</h3>The mind is endowed with the properties of Trigunatwa i.e., Satva, Rajas and
            Tamas. The
            Akasha is represented in Satvaguna, Vayu and Teja are represented in Rajas while Prithvi and
            Jala are represented in Tamas. Satva, Rajas and Tamas are the three essential constituents of
            mind, of which last two are noted Manas dosha, which can potently cause Mano vyadhi
            (mental disorders). Out of these three, Satva is only pure in quality (Positive Elements) while,
            Rajas and Tamas are said to be impure (Manas dosha). Activities of Psyche are due to the
            dynamic interplay between the 3 Gunas. According to Sushruta, the predominance of either
            Satva guna or Mano doshas will show the following charateristics:
            Sattvika - Truthfulness, sharing nature, Endurance, Good conducts, Belief in God,
            Knowledge, Intellect, Capacity to learn, Memory and Self-control, these are the characteristic
            features of Satva Guna predominant person
            Rajasika - Rajo Guna predominant persons are always in grief, lack of self-control, inflated
            self-esteem, Lying nature, Cruelty, Wickedness, Pride, Excitation, Attachment and Anger.
            Tamasika - Tamo Guna predominant persons are in depressed mood, lack of faith in God,
            lack of good conducts, intellectual deficits, ignorance, crookedness, laziness and sleepiness.
            All the positive attributes of the mind are due to the Satva constituent, and unwholesome
            activities are results of Rajas and Tamas constituents.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Causes of mental diseases
            </h3>Asatmendriyartha Samyoga (Misuse of senses) is regarded as one of the principal cause of
            diseases. Astmaya means "improper," indriya means "sense organs," artha is "The objects,
            which are perceived through the sensory organs." and samyoga means "to combine" or "to
            link." Asatmendriyartha samyoga refers to improper contact of the senses with their objects,
            and results in an over stimulation or deficiency of sensory activity. This harms the bodymind, which
            requires moderation and harmony internally and externally for healthy
            functioning.
            Considering Manas as an independent Indriya, it must have its own objects, which are
            experienced by the mind. Thus, besides being capable of perceiving Indriya Visaya (sensory
            objects), Manas has the ability of experiencing its own objects like anything that is
            thinkable.[9]
            Thus, the objects of manas are:
            Chintya - Object of thinking about do‟s and dont‟s
            Vicharya – Object of Reasoning, logic and discrimination
            Uhya – Object of Judgment or guessing
            Dhyeya –Object of continuous thinking about desired things
            Sankalpa – Object of imagination and evaluation as to merit and demerit.
            So, avoidance of ati, hina, and mithya yoga of Chintya, Vicharya, Uhya, Dhyeya and
            Sankalpa cure the mental disorders.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>3 types of treatments modalities</h3>Treatment methods according to Charaka has been classified into 3
            categories; Daiva
            Vyapasrya – divine therapy, Yukti Vyapasrya – Planned regimen of food and medicine, and
            Satvavajaya -psychotherapy. Mental wellbeing has been classified under Satvavajaya
            swasthvitta and Sadvritta and yoga. Satvavajaya Chikitsa is considered to be having the
            psychospiritual approach with a nonpharmacological treatment modality which deals with the
            mind and its related attributes. Satvavajaya Chikitsa helps in controlling Mana (mind) away
            from Ahita Artha (distractible, unwholesome objects/thoughts/perceptions). Withdrawal of
            the bothered mind from unwholesome objects is the prime focus of Satvavajaya Chikitsa.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Satvavajaya chikitsa</h3>
            <h3>सत्वावजयः- पुनरहितेभ्योSर्थेभ्यो मनोननग्रिः।
            </h3>It is defined as method of controlling or restraining mind from unwholesome artha. Arth or
            Objects of Mind are Chintyam, Vicharyam, Oohyam, Dhyeyam, Sankalpam. Arth or Objects
            of Senses are Vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste. It can be inferred that Artha can be either
            Panchedriyartha or Mano Artha. But in Satvavjaya, it is quite logical to consider Mano Artha.
            Ahit (unwholesome) includes Heen yog (non indulgence), Mithya yoga (improper
            indulgence), Ati yoga (Excessive indulgence). Asatmendriyarth samyoga is regarded as one
            of the principal causes of disease. So, avoidance of Ati, Hina, and Mithya Yoga of Chintya,
            Vicharya, Uhya, Dhyeya and Sankalpa are important factors to cure the Psychiatric
            disorders.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Dimensions of satwavajaya chikitsa</h3>Acharya Charaka has mentioned the following line of treatment for
            management of Manasa
            Roga under Satwavajaya Chikitsa.
            <ol>
                <li> Ahitanam Anupsevana and Hitanam Upasevana[13] One should avoid Ahitakara (harmful)
                    and adopting Hitakara (useful). In other words, it has been advised that mind should be
                    restrained from unwholesome objects and engaged in wholesome. </li>
                <li> Trivarga Anvekshanam. Trivarga comprises of Dharma-virtue, Artha-wealth and Kaamdesire. Trivarga
                    is responsible for Sukha and Dukha. Therefore, consideration of Trivarga
                    is must, which can be attained by proper knowledge. Anvekshana means to search or
                    investigate So, the search for life or the above-mentioned Dharma, Artha, Kaam real
                    objectives of life is called as trivarga-anvekshana.</li>
                <li> Tadvidyaseva; One who know the proper treatment of mental illness should treat the
                    diseases.</li>
                <li> Atmadi Vigyanam: One should attain the knowledge of Atma (self), Desha (place), Kula
                    (family), Kala (time), Bala (mental strength), and Shakti (capacity).</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Methods of the satwavajaya chikitsa</h3>Acharya Charak while defining the manas rog chikitsa, says that
            the mano rog chikitsa also
            called the Sattvavajaya chikitsa comprises of the following entities: <br>मानसो ज्ञानववज्ञानर्धयै स्य
            मनृतसमाधर्धभ ः।
            <ol>
                <li> Gyana (Spiritual knowledge): The word Gyana stands for Atmagyana; i.e., knowledge
                    of self and soul, spiritual knowledge and true knowledge. Atmagyan also refers to the
                    complete knowledge of the Sarira and the Mana.</li>
                <li> Vigyana: Educating the patient: (Specific knowledge or scriptural knowledge) The
                    spiritual and the textual knowledge which takes the person to the true and the valid
                    knowledge is Vigyana. It gradually diminishes the Rajasik and Tamasik quality of the
                    mind and increases the Satwik quality.</li>
                <li> Dhairya (Patience or controlling power or moral boosting): Dhairya refers to the
                    stability of mind. It is Dhairya, which restraints the mind from unwholesome objects and
                    can control the mind. Mind can be restrained only after adopting Dhairya, which is an
                    important tool of Satwavajaya chikitsa</li>
                <li> Samriti (Memory –Reviving the knowledge): Trying to memorize the past incidences.
                    Charaka explains that if one remembers the real nature of the thing, he gets rid of all the
                    diseases. Tatwagyana can be attained by Smriti.</li>
                <li>Samadhi (Meditation, abstaining from over indulgence in materialistic world):
                    Samadhi is the condition where after gaining complete contact with the Atma, Mana loses
                    its contact with the external objects and conjunctions with the Atma. It is a specialized
                    concept of Yoga mostly regarded as either spiritual or psychological technique to develop
                    the ideal human personality, leading to the state of character transformation and
                    attainment of final goal of life towards salvation.</li>
            </ol>
            In brief Satwavajaya i.e., Ayurvedic Psychotherapy includes promotions of Jnana, Vigyana
            by improving Dhee, Dhriti and Smriti i.e., by avoiding Pragyapradha.

            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Sadvritta</h3>Ayurveda describes health as a balance of body, mind, social and spiritual well-being. In
            order to achieve this, Ayurveda prescribes certain codes of conduct and this is known as
            Sadvritta. The root „Sad‟ means good and „vritta‟ means regimen. Sadvrittas are applicable to
            people of all age groups, at all times and at all places. Practicing the codes constantly brings
            inner peace and happiness, and violating them makes a person angry and agitated.
            Sadvritta are Ethical Regimen or rules of good conduct. Ayurveda prescribes certain rules for
            maintaining healthy mind. These are principles of right conduct that are applicable to all
            people at all times and places. Practicing them gives balance and harmony to the mind. these
            are always speak the truth, do not lose your temper under any circumstances, do not get
            addicted to sensory pleasures, do not harm anyone, as far as possible, do not expose yourself
            to hardships, try to control your passions, endeavour to speak pleasant and sweet words,
            meditate every day for tranquillity of mind, observe cleanliness in all things, be patient,
            observe self-control, try to distribute knowledge, good advice and help to others, whenever

            drinking, too much sexual activity, too much or too little sleep, behave according to the time
            and place where you are residing. The codes of conduct can be divided as - Ethical
            or Vyavaharika sadvritta, Social or Samajika sadvritta, Mental or Manasika sadvritta, Moral
            or Dharmika sadvritta, and Physical or Sharirika sadvritta. Practising Sadvritta will improve
            the overall health and mental well-being of individuals.</p>

            <h3>Yoga and Mental health </h3>Ashtanga Yoga is a traditional form of yoga combining vigorous exercise and
            controlled
            breathing with the goal of inducing a meditative state through its physical practice. Yogic
            relaxation is the means of getting free from stress, which is supposed to be a major causative
            factor of mental illnesses, various types of relaxation procedures have been advised for the
            purpose. yogic practices enhance muscular strength and body flexibility, promote and
            improve respiratory and cardiovascular function, promote recovery from and treatment of
            addiction, reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, improve sleep patterns, and
            enhance overall well-being and quality of life. The eight limbs are comprised of ethical principles for
            living a meaningful and purposeful
            life; serving as a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline, they direct
            attention towards one's health while acknowledging the spiritual aspects of one's nature. Any
            of the eight limbs may be used separately, but within yoga philosophy the physical postures
            and breathing exercises prepare the mind and body for meditation and spiritual development.

            <h3>Asana</h3>“Sthirsukhmsanam” Asana is a posture that one can hold for a period of time, staying
            relaxed, steady, comfortable and motionless.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Pranayama</h3>Prāṇāyāma is the control of the breath, from the Sanskrit Prana (breath) and Aayama,
            restraint). After a desired posture has been achieved, verses through recommend Pranayam,
            the practice of consciously regulating the breath (inhalation, the full pause, exhalation, and
            the empty pause. This is done in several ways, such as by inhaling and then suspending
            exhalation for a period, exhaling and then suspending inhalation for a period, by slowing the
            inhalation and exhalation, or by consciously changing the timing and length of the breath</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Pratyahara</h3>Pratyahara is drawing within one's awareness. It is a process of retracting the sensory
            experience from external objects. It is a step of self-extraction and abstraction. Pratyahara is
            not consciously closing one's eyes to the sensory world, it is consciously closing one's mind
            processes to the sensory world. Pratyahara empowers one to stop being controlled by the
            external world, fetch one's attention to seek self-knowledge and experience the freedom
            innate in one's inner world.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Dharana </h3>Dharana means concentration, introspective focus and one-pointedness of mind.
            Dharana, as the sixth limb of yoga, is holding one's mind onto a particular inner state, subject
            or topic of one's mind. The mind is fixed on a mantra, or one's breath/navel/tip of tongue/any
            place, or an object one wants to observe, or a concept/idea in one's mind. Fixing the mind
            means one-pointed focus, without drifting of mind, and without jumping from one topic to
            another.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Dhyana
            </h3>Dhyana (Sanskrit: literally means "contemplation, reflection" and "profound, abstract
            meditation"
            Dhyana is contemplating, reflecting on whatever Dharana has focused on. If in the sixth limb
            of yoga one focused on a personal deity, Dhyana is its contemplation. If the concentration
            was on one object, Dhyana is non-judgmental, non-presumptuous observation of that
            object. If the focus was on a concept/idea, Dhyana is contemplating that concept/idea in all its
            aspects, forms and consequences. Dhyana is uninterrupted train of thought, current of
            cognition, flow of awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Samadhi </h3>Samadhi literally means "putting together, joining, combining with, union, harmonious
            whole, trance". Samadhi is that spiritual state when one's mind is so absorbed in whatever it
            is contemplating on, that the mind loses the sense of its own identity. The thinker, the thought
            process and the thought fuse with the subject of thought. There is only oneness, Samadhi.
            </p>
            <p>

            enormous effect on their mental status</p>
