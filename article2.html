            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>Ayurveda has the ability to revolutionize the modern healthcare system
            and make the future medical system more sustainable. Its “Prevention
            is better than cure” purpose, aims to provide solutions for a healthy
            lifestyle to promote overall well-being. Ayurveda is a science of life
            with a holistic approach to health and personalized medicine.
            Ayurveda is a complete medical system that comprised physical,
            psychological, philosophical, ethical, and spiritual health.[1] Ayurveda
            has ability to treat many chronic diseases such as arthritis, asthma,
            diabetes and lifestyle disorders. Lifestyle disorders are constituted of
            diseases which arise because of unhealthy lifestyle. The important
            factors responsible for lifestyle disorders are low physical activity,
            unhealthy food habits, disturbed sleep patterns and incorrect body
            posture. This may increase the risk of developing certain critical illness
            in the later stage of life. The incidence of lifestyle diseases like diabetes mellitus, increased
            Cholesterol level, increased blood pressure and overweight associated with cardiovascular
            diseases is high on the rise. Ayurveda blends our lifestyle and health-oriented habits with the
            ancient wisdom of using Ayurvedic basic Principles, Ayurvedic medicines and natural herbs
            to help us lead a healthy, happy and disease-free life. Six types of treatment modalities have
            been mentioned in Ayurveda, known as Shadvidh-Upakram.
            [2]
            These are very beneficial in
            prevention and management of lifestyle diseases. In Ayurveda causes of a disease are
            classified into two types Santarpanjanya and Aptarpanjanya. These diseases are caused by
            unhealthy food habits and lifestyle. Santarpanjanya diseases are caused by taking food
            excess in quantity and lack of physical activities while Aptarpanjanya diseases are caused by
            intake of food less in quantity and more physical activities.
            [3]
            These Shadvidh-Upakram are
            used for prevention and cure of diseases.</p>

            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>Ayurveda effectively describes ways to prevent and manage lifestyle disorders;
            therefore, the
            world is being attracted towards its holistic approach. Ayurveda provides a better solution in
            the forms of proper dietary management, healthy lifestyle approaches, detoxification and
            rejuvenation. Maintaining health of healthy individual and treating the illness of a diseased is
            the main fundamental principle of Ayurveda. For applicability of this principal Acharya
            Charak mentioned six types of treatment protocol: langhan, brinhan, rukshan, stambhan,
            snehan, and swedan.
            [4]
            The whole treatment protocols of Ayurveda are included under two
            main principles of treatment as described by acharya vagbhaṭ. santarpaṇ and apatarpaṇ are
            the two main treatment modalities which are also known as langhan and bṛinhaṇ
            respectively.</p>
            <h3>Six types of Treatment/Shadvidh upakrama</h3>
            <p>
            <h3>Langhan </h3>The treatment which brings lightness and emaciation to the body is called Langhan-the
            deprivation treatment, also called de-nourishing treatment. Langhan therapy is highly
            effective and increasingly popular in management of diseases due to overnutrition. Langhan
            Dravya are having properties like light, hot, sharp, non-slimy, rough, subtle, dry, fluid and
            hard.
            [5]
            Langhan Upakrama creates lightness in the body in case of condition suggesting
            dominance of kaphadosha.[6] Kaphadosha causes blockage of channels of the body which
            results in manifestation of diseases like as obesity, diabetes and heart diseases etc. This
            kaphadosha may disturb the proper functioning of Jatharagni which may lead to
            agnimandya. Langhan is One of the most important treatment principles. Whenever aam
            dosha increases in the body it disturbs the level of doshas, blocks the body channels, and
            leads to heaviness. In such condition langhan is best treatment whereby it helps in removing
            blockages of channels and brings lightness in body. Ten types of langhan therapies
            mentioned in ayurvedic texts. four types of elimination therapy (vaman, virechan, niruh vasti
            and nasya), control of thirst, exposure of the wind, exposure of the sun, intake of substance
            that stimulates digestion, fasting and physical exercise.[7]
            Langhan therapy is recommended for diseases in which there is a heaviness in the body or an obstruction in
            channels, such as
            diabetes, sinusitis, asthma, indigestion, obesity, high cholesterol and fever etc. Langhan
            treatments are broadly categorised in two types: 1. Shodhan (purification), which removes
            highly aggravated doshas by its eliminatory action from the body. 2. Shaman (palliative),
            which transforms dosha vaishamyata into dosha samyata by its subsiding- action in the body.
            In context of shodhan; Vaman is the best example for managing increased kaph dosh in
            tamak shwas/bronchial asthma.[8]
            Virechan is beneficial in amlapitt[9]
            similarly vasti in
            avaranajanya vatvyadhi[10]
            and shirovirechan in kaphaj shirashool.
            [11] Other types of langhan
            like pipasa, aatpa and maruta sewan in alpadosh, upavas in taruna jwar as principle of
            management starts with langhan.[12]
            Deepan pachan in aam conditions to bring it to niram state, vyayama in urustambh and
            obesity shows effectiveness of shaman type of langhan.
            [13]
            Benefits of Langhan therapy includes: feeling of hunger and thirst, purity of heart and mind,
            clearness of throat, diseases become less severe, enthusiasm increases, disappearance of
            lassitude.[14]
            Langhan digests aam dosha and increase digestive power and establishes doshas
            in equilibrium. Langhan leads to decrease in intensity dosha, increases agni or digestive fire
            and brings lightness in the body. Thirst and hunger develop well accordingly.
            As like Ayurveda modern science too states the theory of autophagy which resembles to
            langhan therapy. Autophagy is physiological process in the body that deals with cell
            destruction in the body, it maintains homeostasis or normal functioning by protein
            degradation and turnover of the destroyed cell organelle for new cell formations. During
            cellular stress the process of autophagy is upscaled and increased, cellular stress is caused
            when there is deprivation of nutrients or growth factors. Hence autophagy may come up with
            an alternative source of intracellular building blocks and substrates that may originate energy
            to enable continuous cell survival. Autophagy reduces damaged organelles, cell membranes
            and proteins. Failure autophagy is the main reason for accumulation of cell damage and
            aging.[15]
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Brinhan</h3>The term brinhan means building, nourishing or strengthening. The brinhan therapies are
            indicated in degenerative conditions to nourish and replenish the depleted body components.
            The medicines or procedures increase bulk of body components. Thus, this therapy makes body strong and
            firm.[16]
            The dravya which provide nourishment to the body is known as
            brinhan dravya. The nourishing substance possess properties like heavy (guru) leading to
            fullness, cold potency (sheet), softness (mridu), unctuousness (snigdh), thickness (bahal),
            gross (sthool), sliminess (pichchhil), slowness (mand), stability (sthir) and smoothness
            (shlakshn).[17]
            These drugs are having dominancy of prithvi and aap mahabhoot. This
            treatment is included under Santarpan chikitsa. These drugs act at the level of dhatvagni and
            thus helps in proper nourishment of dhatu. Those patients who are lean and thin or suffering
            from related disorders such as general debility, weight loss etc. are treated with the use of
            brinhan chikitsa.
            The brinhan dravya by a virtue of their properties increases the bulkiness of dhatu and body
            and it mainly focus on structural and functional aspect of respective dhatu and organs
            therefore increase the strength and weight of body. We can say that these drugs increase the
            absorptions of micro-nutrients at the level of agni by promoting the digestion and metabolism
            in the body and boost up the immunity. It also acts at the level of srotas by promoting the
            microcirculation and tissue perfusion along providing direct nutrition to tissue. So brinhan
            therapy helps to strengthen and rejuvenate the body.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>Rookshan</h3>Rookshan means drying; the treatment that causes dryness, roughness in the body is called
            Rookshan. The therapy by which the oily, sticky and fatty constituents of the body are dried up,
            which also eliminates excess mucus, fat and water from the tissues and organs of the body is
            known as Rookshan.[18]
            The drugs which make the body rough have the properties of rooksh, laghu, khar, teekshan,
            sthir, pichchhil, kathin and drav.
            [19]
            It can be used in kaphaj Diseases like as diabetes, heart
            diseases, obesity, thyroid dysfunctions, inflammatory diseases and so many. If there is
            dominance of kaphadosha, rookshan chikitsa should be done.
            The rookshan chikitsa dries the body and makes it looking thinner with absorption of all the
            body fluids which is not essential in the body. So many diseases in body are manifested by
            aam dosha caused by mandagni. This aam dosha accumulate in the body causes srotovarodh
            which affects the proper nutrition of next dhatu. if we apply rookshan chikitsa in such
            conditions, it has a role in the digestion of aam dosha. Rookshan can be done both externally
            and internally. External Rookshan is carried out by procedures such as Udvartan and
            application of various rooksh lepas whereas internal rookshan is done with administration of
            takra pana, rooksh anna sewan and rooksh drugs.

            <p>
            <h3>Snehan</h3>The treatment by which oiliness (snigdhata), liquefaction (vishyandata), softness
            (mardavata) and moistness (kledata) are achieved called as snehan.
            [21]
            These drugs have the
            properties like sukshm, sar, snigdh, pichchhil, guru, sheet, mand and mridu.[22] According to
            action, snehan are of 3 types <ol type="A">
                <li> Shodhan: Sneha administered prior to Shodhan is known as Shodhan Sneha. It is
                    administered for the purpose of Dosh Utkleshan prior to vaman and virechan.
                    [24]</li>
                <li>Shaman: Sneha administered processed with herbs that can cure diseases. In general, the
                    sneha dosage is administered in empty stomach when person feels hungry during Ann
                    kaal.
                    [25]</li>
                <li> Brinhan: Small amounts of sneha given along with food for the purpose of nourishment
                    is known as Brinhan Sneha.[26]</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>According to route of administration, snehan are of 2 types[27]
            </h3>
            <ol type="A">
                <li> External (Bahya) such as Abyang, Lep, Avagah, Parisekh, karnapooran, akshitarpan.</li>
                <li> Internal (Abhyantar) like Snehpan, Basti, Nasya.</li>
            </ol>Snehan karma is performed as Purvakarma in relation to various shodhan therapies. It
            improves the digestive power, renovates of body tissues, increase body strength, improve
            skin texture, delay aging process. It acts as solvent. It brings the lodged morbid and
            unexcreted waste products in to gastro-intestinal tract which can be further expelled out
            through oral or anal route by the use of shodhana chikitsa. </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Swedan
            </h3>It is the process by which the sweat is produced in the body by using various methods so that
            stiffness, heaviness and coldness of body is relieved.[28]
            Elimination of toxins and wastes
            through sweat takes place in this treatment. Properties of drugs used for swedan are ushn,
            teekshn, sar, snigdh, ruksh, sukshm, drav, sthir and guru.
            [29]
            Swedan is a treatment commonly practiced either as a preparatory procedure
            to Panchakarma therapy or as an independent intervention. It is very essential and important
            poorvkarm of panchkarma therapy. Swedan treatment is also recommended as a first line
            therapy to many musculoskeletal and neuromuscular conditions identified as vataj nanatmaj
            diseases in Ayurveda which are caused by Vata dosha alone. The action of sudation
            /fomentation is to liquify the entire toxin present in diseases area from where they come out
            from the body through sweating. Mainly there are two methods of Swedan, niragni represents
            the method where the body is warmed without getting heated directly. This method is similar
            to what we understand as active heat therapy. Common examples to this variety are heavy
            clothing, exercise, etc. on other hand, saagni swedan utilizes various methods of applying dry
            or moist heat directly upon the body to make it warm. This method is similar to conventional
            methods of passive heat therapies.[30]
            Swedan is well known for its relaxing and detoxifying
            effects.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Stambhan
            </h3>The treatment that prevents mobility and the flow of body substances and fluids is known as
            stambhan chikitsa.
            [31]
            The drugs which are used in this treatment are called stambhan dravya.
            Stambhan treatment involves stopping movement of vitiated doshas. Properties of stambhan
            drugs are laghu, sheet, mridu, drav, slakshn, ruksh, sukshm and sthir.
            [32]
            These drugs increase
            the jal and prithvi mahabhoot. Pichchha vasti in rakta atiisar and avapeed nasya in nasagat
            raktapitt are few of the best examples of stambhan.
            [33]
            There are various drugs which can be
            used as a stambhak dravya like durva, lodhra, priyangu and mochras etc. These stambhan
            drugs have kashay rasa dominancy and act like as vasoconstrictor. This treatment is very
            important in stopping haemorrhage, preventing and treating blood loss, diarrhoea and other
            disorders like ulcerative colitis.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>Shadvidh upakrama helps to balance the abnormality of tridoshas in the body. Langhan is
            beneficial in Kapha-Pittaj abnormalities. Brinhan act as Vaat-Pitt har. Rukshan decrease the
            Kapha and Pitta, Snehan is Vata-Pittahara, Swedan is Vata-Kaph-har and Stambhan
            eliminates the Pitta and Vata dosha.
            Shadvidh upakrama also act upon gurvadi gunas as per the principles of samanya vishesh.
            Langhan possess the laghu guna, brinhan has guru, rookshan has ruksh, snehan has snigdh,
            swedan has ushn and stambhan has sheet guna. This principle signifies importance of these
            six modalities of treatment. Shadvidh upakrama plans to act by balancing the proportion of
            the panchmahabhutas in the body. As brinhan acts by increasing prithvi and jal mahabhoot.
            Snehan increases the jal and prithvi mahabhoot, Stambhan increases the prithvi and jal,
            langhan increases the akash, vayu and agni mahabhoot, rukshan increases akash, vayu and
            agni. Swedan increases agni, vayu and akasha mahabhoot. These are responsible for the
            metabolic activity of the body. So Shadvidh upakrama are helpful in balancing tridosh.</p>
            <p>
            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>Main aim of shadvidh upakrama is balancing Dosha or Dosh Saamyata. It is attained through
            balancing the gunas, ultimately by achieving the Panchabhouthika stability. Shadvidh
            upakrama works on the principle of the samanya vishesh sidhant and acts by balancing the
            proportion and on the basis of the combination of panchmahabhutas in the body. In brief
            there are main 3 action of shadvidh upakrama;
            <ol>
                <li>Shadvidh upakrama act by balancing the proportion of the panchmahabhutas in the body</li>
                <li>Shadvidh upakrama acts on the principles of samanya vishesh of the gurvadi gunas.
                </li>
                <li>Shadvidh upakrama helps to balance the tridoshas in the body.
                </li>
            </ol>Shadvidh Upakram is used both for prevention and cure of disease.
